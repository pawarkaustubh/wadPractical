✅ 1. Install Angular CLI globally

sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
This installs the Angular Command Line Interface (CLI), which is used to create and manage Angular projects.

✅ 2. Create a new Angular project
ng new my-angular-app
It will ask:

Would you like to add Angular routing? → (Type y or n)

Which stylesheet format? → (Choose CSS/SCSS etc.)

✅ 3. Navigate into the project folder

cd my-angular-app

✅ 4. Run the development server

ng serve
Or, to allow access from other devices (e.g., mobile on same network):


ng serve --host 0.0.0.0
Then open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:4200
